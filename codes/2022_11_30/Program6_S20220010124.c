    Let
        v1 = speed when ball hits the ground for the first time
        v2 = speed when ball hits the ground for the second time
        v3 = speed when ball hits the ground for the third time

        h1 = distance travelled by the ball when it hits the ground for the first time. 
        h2 = distance travelled by the ball between the first and second time hiting the ground. 
        h3 = distance travelled by the ball between the second and third time hiting the ground.
        g = gravity


    h1 = h
        let assume as h for the time being


    h2 = h/2
        lets find the speed when bounce from the ground for the first time

        from v^2 - u^2 = 2as 
        v1 = (2gh)^1/2 (since initial velocity u1 = 0)
        given that speed becomes half each time it bounces on the floor
        so it will bounce back with velocity u2 = v1 * 1/2

        Caluculating the h2 value

        from v^2 - u^2 = 2as
            
        distance travelled in upward journey= u2^2/2g

                                            = (2gh/4) / 2g
                                            = h/4

        h2  = distance travelled in upward journey + distance travelled in downward journey
            = distance travelled in upward journey * 2
            = (h/8)*2
            = h/4


    h3 = h/8
        lets find the speed when bounce from the ground for the second time

        from v2 = U2 = = V1/2 
        v2 = ((2gh)^1/2)/2 (since initial velocity u = 0)
        given that speed becomes half each time it bounces on the floor
        so it will bounce back with velocity u3 = v2 * 1/2
        = ((2gh)^1/2)/4

        Caluculating the h3 value

        from v^2 - u^2 = 2gh
            
        distance travelled in upward journey = u3^2/2g
        = ((2gh)/16)/ 2g

        h3  = distance travelled in upward journey + distance travelled in downward journey
            = distance travelled in upward journey * 2

            =h/8


    Total distance travelled by the ball when it touches the ground for the third time
